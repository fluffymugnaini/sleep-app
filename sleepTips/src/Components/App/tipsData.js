    "~ Lie down with ur legs up the wall for a couple of mins.",
    "~ Just thought I’d mention some stuff that’s helped for me. I should say all of this doesn’t work all of the time. And I have a constant battle with it. White noise and stuff helps. Counting and breath - mainly counting breaths to focus the mind - helps me to keep focussed. My mind is too busy for the general instruction of meditation.",
    "~ A tip I read which I've sometimes found useful is *trying to stay awake*... like you're in bed, it's dark, you're def there to sleep and set up for that, but your mind is saying 'you need to stay awake' and sometimes it actually really works to drop off.",
    "~ I’ve taken to audio books on sleep timers - I tend to have to wind back aimlessly the next evening to find a place I remember - but in particular Barack O’bama’s voice is good for helping me drop off. Just don’t pick any books you get too hooked on", 
    "~ Fatiguing myself has been really helpful: getting my exercise quota in. Depriving myself (forcefully) of naps. Forcing myself into getting up at a given time - even if I’ve had a shitty night’s sleep - but without judgement of my sleep time.",

    "~ Warm bath, lavender, take mind on a trip along your childhood street & visualise every front door (kind of counting sheet equivalent, surprisingly rewarding), treat bedroom as a separate space - don’t work there during day.", 
    "~ Only go to bed when I’m tired. And I mean not just nodding but dropping! It’s a bit torturous. But it has helped. Also, sometimes I fear the fight is the worst bit. And not judging yourself for what your body needs in that moment - including allowing for an overactive mind - feels a bit woolly, but there’s a truth in it, I guess.",
    "~ CBD drops, a cold pillow, very boring podcasts (when they don’t work, you learn some very random things), sometimes opening a window and breathing that fresh v early morning air until I have a little cry.",
    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/CKeN6uBH73Q/?igshid=z9mqdvklwk7c">This Yoga Sesh with Peter Hobday</a>,
    "~ Journaling for 30mins awhile before bed! Write out the experiences in the day, worries etc. I find it helpful because when I get insomnia it is mainly due to a whirring mind.",
    "~ Sleep spray has been great for me, cold pillow and having some ventilation in the room (even if it's cold). Sleep stories with the Calm app have also worked!",
    "~ Sensory deprivation helps me - total darkness, noise cancelling headphones / ear plugs, etc. Sometimes (really a hit or miss) ASMR, binaural beats, white noise etc or other sensory focus tools have been helpful.",
    "~ Neom sleep spray sometimes helps me - there are a variety out there. That and disciplined counting of breathing until you're so bored of hearing your own voice in your head that the subconscious shuts it off with sleep.",

    "~ When I lie in bed and can't sleep I don't fight it, but actively get up and engage in something really mentally strenuous, like kind of beating the remaining energy out of my brain. Recently I've found linocutting does the trick because its super high focus.",
    "~ It’s natural - it’s a PANNY D. Just embrace it and watch real housewives until you drop off",
    "~ Eurgh insomnia is awful..I find telling myself it doesn't matter if I go to sleep or not I'm just gonna have a nice rest/relaxing time doing whatever I want is helpful cos it takes away the anxiety. Also getting up, going into another room/having another shower + changing clothes",
    "~ High dose magnesium before bed. 5htp before bed and I’m currently using the headspace sleep casts. White noise and a sort of story that calms your brain. I suck at meditation. It’s infuriating though.",

    "~ I find I have no problem falling asleep if I’ve done some decent exercise that day that’s tired me out. Your muscles wanting to repair will make you more likely to sleep. So yeah, a cheesy YouTube works out might be your friend.",
    "~ Adult colouring books and listening to Piano Chill playlist on Apple Music before bed. If I wake up in the middle of the night and awake more than 20 minutes then I get up and colour.",
    "~ The biggest thing for me was actually just not trying! I usually listen to a podcast with a sleep timer & that often works, or I read/make lists/watch something that I’ve seen 100 times that I don’t need to focus on whilst in bed. Sometimes I literally just get up completely & do some work or watch something more involved, or my favourite thing is to do yoga haha! Yin yoga has really helped me at night."
